# Type_Away


#####This is an application that brings your creative writing to a wider audience.
#####Users will have to sign up and make an account.
#####Once account is created users can let their imagination take the drivers seat.
#####Posting that short story you wrote while you were on the toilet, can now get feedback from other users.
#####Technologies being used are HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, ruby, rails, PostgreSQL , devise and some SVG animations.
####Installation is simple, just clone the repo, load up terminal, run command 'rails s', then go to your local host to view locally. Alternatively, you could just go type-away.herokuapp.com sign up for an account and start posting!

## Unsolved problems
####User comments were labeled with user names, working locally, wasn't working in heroku so it was taken out. 
####Avatar uploading working locally, AWS and figaro not working ?:(

## Next Steps
#### Adding a genre to post and a type to post (short story, poem , haiku, ghost story)
#### Adding a search bar where you can search by name of post, post by a user, eventually post types.
#### Adding a format option for Posts so users can style their post (indentation and aligning)
